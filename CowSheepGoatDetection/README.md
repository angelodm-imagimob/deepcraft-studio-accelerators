# Cow Sheep Goat Detection

This project is designed to work exclusively with DEEPCRAFT™ Studio. Download it from [here](https://softwaretools.infineon.com/assets/com.ifx.tb.tool.deepcraftstudio)

## Overview - Use-Case

The **Cow Sheep Goat Detection** project builds an end-to-end system that identifies **cows**, **sheep**, and **goats** from camera or live video input.

The object detection model is YOLO-based and it can be used in applications for

- **Livestock monitoring:** Detect cows, sheep, and goats in barn, pasture, or farm cameras
- **Precision agriculture:** Count and track animals for herd management and automated farm systems
- **Farm security:** Flag livestock in a camera view for alerting or access control around barns and paddocks

Users can further expand this project by training their own models, importing new data, and evaluating performance using the provided tools.

- **Machine learning method:** YOLO-based object detection trained in DEEPCRAFT™ Studio
- **Sensor and data type:** RGB camera or live video input (image data)
- **Why it matters:** Enables livestock monitoring and farm automation from live camera feeds, provided the model is trained on images that match the deployment camera.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Detection**: The project uses a YOLO-based model to detect and classify cows, sheep, and goats accurately and in real-time.
2. **Custom Data Integration**: Users can add new data through the data import or using `Object Detection Data Collection Graph UX` template and label their own data for model training.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate trained models by double-clicking the `.tflite` file; it will generate a Graph UX project to run.

## Contents

- **`Data`**: Contains starter data from Roboflow with images of cows, sheep, and goats: [Cow sheep goat datasets](https://universe.roboflow.com/search?q=cow%20sheep%20goat%20object%20detection). Data consists of 8,317 annotated sessions (7,450 cow, 5,556 sheep, 4,585 goat bounding boxes), grouped into class folders (`cow_dataset*`, `sheep_dataset*`, `goat_dataset*`). Sources mix dedicated cattle, sheep, and goat sets with a multi-class livestock set that is split by the class in each image, including close-up farm views so animals occupy a usable fraction of the 320 px training image. Labels that were too small at that training size were removed.

- **`Models`** - Stores the trained YOLO-based model and its quantized versions as well as their predictions.

- **`Resources`** - Folder containing supporting project files, including `rename_mapping.csv` and `rename_mapping.json` which map the current session image names back to their original Roboflow source filenames.

## Steps to get started: Model Training and Evaluation

1. Train the YOLO-based model using the provided dataset or custom data.
2. Download the trained model `.tflite` file from the trained job.
3. Double-click the `.tflite` file and it will create a Graph UX project.
4. Run the Graph UX project to evaluate model performance in real time using the selected camera.
5. Put in front of the camera pictures with cows, sheep, and goats and observe detection from live camera.

## Sensor(s) & Data

Image data is stored as DEEPCRAFT™ Studio object-detection sessions under `Data/`. Each session contains a JPG image and `LabelXml` annotations with normalized center bounding boxes (`X`, `Y`, `Width`, `Height`). The project currently contains 8,317 sessions targeting cows, sheep, and goats.

**Small-box cleaning:** Sessions were filtered so tiny labels do not remain in the training set. At the 320 px training size, boxes whose shorter side is under 24 px are dropped, and images that would be left with unlabeled animals after that cut are skipped entirely. Distant specks that a 320 px detector cannot localize reliably are therefore not used as positives.

**Training augmentation:** Values below are the DEEPCRAFT™ Studio Augmentation Settings stored in `CowSheepGoatDetection.improj`. They are chosen for upright farm animals at 320 px: enough lighting and pose variety for outdoor cameras, without shrinking already-small animals or turning them upside down. Parameter names follow [YOLO data augmentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/yolo-data-augmentation).

- `degrees` 5 — mild rotation for a camera that is not perfectly level; kept small so animals stay recognizable as upright livestock.
- `translate` 0.1 — default shift, so animals can appear off-center as they do when walking through a frame.
- `scale` 0.2 — below the YOLO default (0.5) so mosaic and zoom-out do not shrink animals further at 320 px after small-box cleaning.
- `shear` 0 — left at the default off. Shear distorts body shape and would make cow, sheep, and goat harder to tell apart.
- `fliplr` 0.5 — default left/right flip, so the model does not depend on which way the animal is facing.
- `flipud` 0 — left at the default off. Farm cameras see animals standing on the ground, not upside down.
- `perspective` 0 — left at the default off. Strong perspective warp is a poor match for a mostly side-on or slightly elevated livestock view.
- `bgr` 0 — left at the default off. Channel swap is not a realistic camera failure mode here.
- `mosaic` 0.5 — below the YOLO default (1.0) so four-image mosaics are used only half the time and distant animals are less often packed into tiny tiles.
- `mixup` 0 — left at the default off. Blending two images would overlay animals and confuse box labels.
- `copy_paste` 0 (`CopyPasteMode` Flip) — left at the default off. Pasting animals onto other scenes is unused; the mode setting has no effect while copy-paste is 0.
- `hsv_s` 0.35 — below the YOLO default (0.7) so coat colors stay plausible; sheep vs goat already overlap, and extreme desaturation would make that worse.
- `hsv_v` 0.4 — default brightness jitter for sun, shade, and barn lighting.
- `hsv_h` 0.015 — default small hue shift so outdoor white-balance changes are covered without recoloring coats.

For selecting the most meaningful parameters for Data Augmentations it is important to understand your dataset, the use-case and the environment setup.


**Data sources and commercial-use conditions:**

- `cow_dataset1` (1290 images, MIT): https://universe.roboflow.com/jaaz/cattle-xbqql
  - Dedicated cattle dataset. The `Cattle` class is mapped to `cow`.
- `cow_dataset2` (1573 images, CC BY 4.0): https://universe.roboflow.com/deep-learning-in-livestock/goat-sheet-and-cow-detection
  - Cow sessions from the multi-class livestock set (version 2, no generated augmentations). Boxes whose shorter side is under 24 px at the 320 px training image size are dropped before sessions are written.
- `sheep_dataset1` (630 images, CC BY 4.0): https://universe.roboflow.com/sheeprecognition-7a7fq/sheep-v2-db0s6
  - Dedicated sheep dataset. Images that still contained a box under 24 px at the 320 px training size were left out, so remaining sessions stay fully annotated.
- `sheep_dataset2` (1343 images, CC BY 4.0): https://universe.roboflow.com/deep-learning-in-livestock/goat-sheet-and-cow-detection
  - Sheep sessions from the same multi-class livestock set as `cow_dataset2` and `goat_dataset2`.
- `sheep_dataset3` (820 images, CC BY 4.0): https://universe.roboflow.com/benedict-project/sheep-svfcb
  - Natural farm and pasture sheep photographed at close and medium range. Version 5 carries no generated augmentations. Images containing any sheep whose shorter side is under 24 px at the 320 px training image size are skipped entirely.
- `goat_dataset1` (500 images, CC BY 4.0): https://universe.roboflow.com/z-firewood-house/goat-5eecg
  - Domestic goats photographed on farms and pastures, with varied breeds, poses, and backgrounds.
- `goat_dataset2` (1204 images, CC BY 4.0): https://universe.roboflow.com/deep-learning-in-livestock/goat-sheet-and-cow-detection
  - Goat sessions from the same multi-class livestock set as `cow_dataset2` and `sheep_dataset2`.
- `goat_dataset3` (957 images, CC BY 4.0): https://universe.roboflow.com/karthik-a3uja/goat-olvnd
  - Close-up goats on farms, village roads, and pastures. The export bakes in three augmented copies per photo, so only one copy per original image is imported. Images containing any goat whose shorter side is under 24 px at the 320 px training image size are skipped entirely.

## Adding More Data

You can add more data to the project following the steps below to improve detection or to include new classes.

1. Use `Object Detection Data Collection Graph UX` template to collect and label new data.
2. Import data to your project and retrain to get an updated model.

You can also import data from any other source (for example, your own images or another dataset) as long as it follows the DEEPCRAFT™ Studio object-detection format: images with matching `LabelXml` annotations using normalized center coordinates (`X`, `Y`, `Width`, `Height`). See [Bring your own data for object detection projects](https://developer.imagimob.com/deepcraft-studio/data-preparation/bring-your-data/bring-your-own-data-object-detection).

## Steps to Production

The recommended path to production for this project includes the following steps:

- **Add more data if detection rate is low.** The starter dataset has 8,317 sessions across pasture, barn, and mixed lighting conditions, but performance can drop on your target camera (for example, a fixed barn view, drone, or low-resolution feed). Collect and label images from the actual deployment scene—same angle, distance, and lighting—and retrain until cows, sheep, and goats are detected reliably in that environment.
- **Add more classes if needed.** The project currently detects `cow`, `sheep`, and `goat` only. If your product must distinguish breeds, calves vs adults, or other farm animals, add new classes and label accordingly before retraining.
- **Add negative data, including other animals.** Include empty scenes and look-alikes so the model does not treat every four-legged shape as a cow, sheep, or goat. For a more robust model, add images of **other animals**—horses, donkeys, deer, dogs, pigs, llamas, and similar livestock or wildlife that can appear on a farm—as unlabeled negatives, then retrain.
- **Watch sheep vs goat confusion.** The two species overlap in pose and coat; extra close-up examples from your farm reduce mix-ups that distant pasture shots cannot fix alone.
- **Match augmentation to outdoor variability.** Keep flip up/down off for upright animals; increase flip left/right for varied approach angles; adjust HSV for sun, shade, and indoor barns. Keep scale and mosaic moderate if many animals occupy only a small part of the frame.
- **Tune confidence for your sensitivity target.** Missing an animal may under-count a herd; a false detection may trigger a wasted alert—set thresholds for the cost you care about.

Some points to highlight:

- **Increase data variability:** Collect data from different environments, cameras, lighting conditions, distances, and backgrounds. Use DEEPCRAFT™ Studio augmentation settings (flip, scale, brightness, exposure) to increase image variability for vision models.
- **Keep test data independent:** Make sure the test set is not used in train or validation and reflects scenarios where the model must generalize.
- **Add negative data:** Include images without cows, sheep, or goats, and images of **other animals**, so the model stays robust against false positives.
