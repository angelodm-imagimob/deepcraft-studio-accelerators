# Road Sign Classification

This project is designed to work exclusively with DEEPCRAFT™ Studio. Download it from [here](https://softwaretools.infineon.com/assets/com.ifx.tb.tool.deepcraftstudio)

## Overview - Use-Case

The **Road Sign Classification** project builds an end-to-end system that identifies **43 German traffic sign classes** from camera or live video input, including speed limits, warning signs, prohibitory signs, and mandatory signs (GTSRB).

The image classification model can be used in applications for

- **Autonomous vehicle systems:** Classify traffic signs in a camera view for vehicle perception pipelines
- **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS):** Support speed-limit, warning, and regulatory-sign recognition for driver assistance
- **Traffic monitoring:** Identify common signs for navigation assistance and roadside monitoring

Users can further expand this project by training their own models, importing new data, and evaluating performance using the provided tools.

- **Machine learning method:** Image classification trained in DEEPCRAFT™ Studio
- **Sensor and data type:** RGB camera or live video input (image data)
- **Why it matters:** Enables traffic-sign recognition from live camera feeds, provided the model is trained on images that match the deployment camera, sign set, and country.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Classification**: The project uses a deep learning model to classify traffic signs accurately and in real-time.
2. **Custom Data Integration**: Users can add new data through the data import or using `Image Classification Data Collection Graph UX` template and label their own data for model training.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate trained models by double-clicking the `.tflite` file; it will generate a Graph UX project to run.

## Contents

- **`Data`**: Contains starter data from the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** as RGB PNG sessions **resized to 64×64**, covering **43 traffic sign classes** such as speed limits, stop, yield, no entry, and other warning, mandatory, and prohibitory signs. Data consists of 51,839 labeled sessions grouped into class folders (for example `speed_limit_50km_h`, `stop`, `yield`). Class counts are unbalanced: the largest classes include `speed_limit_50km_h` (3,000), `speed_limit_30km_h` (2,940), and `yield` (2,880); the smallest include `speed_limit_20km_h` (270), `dangerous_curve_left` (270), and `go_straight_or_left` (270).

- **`Models`**: Stores the trained image classification model and its quantized versions as well as their predictions.

## Steps to get started: Model Training and Evaluation

1. Train the image classification model using the provided dataset or custom data.
2. Download the trained model `.tflite` file from the trained job.
3. Double-click the `.tflite` file and it will create a Graph UX project.
4. Run the Graph UX project to evaluate model performance in real time using the selected camera.
5. Put in front of the camera pictures of traffic signs (or capture live roadside views) and observe classification from live camera.

## Sensor(s) & Data

Image data is stored as DEEPCRAFT™ Studio image-classification sessions under `Data/`. Each session contains a 64×64 RGB PNG and a `LabelXml` annotation with a class name (no bounding box). The project currently contains 51,839 sessions targeting 43 GTSRB classes. Sessions are grouped by class folder.

**Image size:** Official GTSRB images are PPM files whose size varies (about 15×15 to 250×250 pixels) and are not always square. For this project they were converted to RGB PNG and resized to **64×64**, which is also the training `ImageSize` in `RoadSignsClassification.improj`. New data should be imported at the same 64×64 RGB size, or resized to match before training.

**Official GTSRB train/test split:** GTSRB is published in two parts: a training set (39,209 images) and a held-out test set (12,630 images). This project keeps that split. The official training images are used for **train** (29,397 sessions, `train_*`) and **validation** (9,812 sessions, `valid_*`). The official test images are used only for the **test** set (12,630 sessions, `test_*`), so evaluation is not mixed with images the model saw during training or validation. The 60/20/20 values stored in the project file are the Studio default target sizes; the assigned sessions follow the official GTSRB partitions above, not a random 60/20/20 draw over all 51,839 images.

**Training augmentation:** Values below are the DEEPCRAFT™ Studio Augmentation Settings stored in `RoadSignsClassification.improj`. They are applied at 64 px. Parameter names follow [YOLO data augmentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/yolo-data-augmentation).

- `degrees` 0 — no rotation; traffic signs are upright, and rotating them can mix similar shapes.
- `translate` 0.1 — default shift, so the sign can sit slightly off-center in the crop.
- `scale` 0.5 — default zoom range for signs seen at different distances.
- `shear` 0 — left at the default off. Shear distorts pictograms and digits.
- `fliplr` 0.5 — left/right flip is currently on. For production, consider turning this off: classes such as `dangerous_curve_left` vs `dangerous_curve_right` and `keep_left` vs `keep_right` reverse meaning when mirrored.
- `flipud` 0 — left at the default off. Road cameras do not see signs upside down.
- `perspective` 0 — left at the default off.
- `bgr` 0 — left at the default off. Channel swap is not a realistic camera failure mode here.
- `mosaic` 1 — default mosaic on.
- `mixup` 0 — left at the default off. Blending two signs would mix class labels.
- `copy_paste` 0 (`CopyPasteMode` Flip) — left at the default off. The mode setting has no effect while copy-paste is 0.
- `hsv_s` 0.7 — default saturation jitter for faded or vivid sign paint.
- `hsv_v` 0.4 — default brightness jitter for sun, shade, and headlights.
- `hsv_h` 0.015 — default small hue shift so white-balance changes are covered without recoloring red/blue sign fields.

For selecting the most meaningful parameters for Data Augmentations it is important to understand your dataset, the use-case and the environment setup.

## Adding More Data

You can add more data to the project following the steps below to improve classification or to include new classes.

1. Use `Image Classification Data Collection Graph UX` template to collect and label new data.
2. Import data to your project and retrain to get an updated model.

You can also import data from any other source (for example, your own images or another dataset) as long as it follows the DEEPCRAFT™ Studio image-classification format: RGB images with matching `LabelXml` class labels. New data should be RGB, matching the existing sessions. See [Bring your own data into DEEPCRAFT™ Studio](https://developer.imagimob.com/deepcraft-studio/data-preparation/bring-your-data) and [Label image data](https://developer.imagimob.com/deepcraft-studio/data-preparation/data-labeling/label-image-data).

## Steps to Production

The recommended path to production for this project includes the following steps:

- **Add more data for traffic sign classes with low classification accuracy.** The starter dataset has 51,839 GTSRB sessions, but several classes have only a few hundred examples (`speed_limit_20km_h`, `dangerous_curve_left`, `go_straight_or_left`). Performance can also drop on your target camera, country, or sign design. Collect and label images from the actual deployment scene—same angle, distance, and lighting—and retrain until those classes are classified reliably.
- **Add more classes if needed.** The project currently classifies the 43 GTSRB classes only. If your product must cover another country, extra speed limits, or extra warning pictograms, add new classes and label accordingly before retraining.
- **Add negative data.** Include non-relevant objects and backgrounds (billboards, logos, buildings, vehicles) as unlabeled negatives so the model does not treat every red or blue shape as a traffic sign, then retrain.
- **Watch directional and digit confusions.** Left/right variants and nearby speed limits (30 vs 50, 80 vs 100) are easy to mix; extra close-up examples from your camera reduce mix-ups that the original GTSRB crops cannot fix alone. Prefer leaving left/right flip off when those classes matter.
- **Match augmentation to roadside variability.** Try different augmentation settings to increase the variability of the dataset, such as rotation and perspective/zoom to mimic viewing signs from different angles and distances, and brightness/contrast changes to cover different lighting conditions. Keep flip up/down off; keep rotation small so pictograms stay readable.
- **Try different advanced settings** such as optimizer or confidence threshold to make the model more or less sensitive. Missing a speed-limit sign may affect driver assistance; a false detection may show the wrong limit—set thresholds for the cost you care about.
- **Add data from different lighting, weather, and driving conditions.** Collect from day, night, dawn, dusk, rain, and fog, and include various camera angles, motion blur, and partial occlusions to enhance classification accuracy in real driving scenarios.

Some points to highlight:

- **Increase data variability:** Collect data from different environments, cameras, lighting and weather conditions, distances, and backgrounds. Use DEEPCRAFT™ Studio augmentation settings (flip, scale, brightness, exposure) to increase image variability for vision models, while keeping left/right flip off if directional classes must stay distinct.
- **Keep test data independent:** Make sure the test set is not used in train or validation and reflects scenarios where the model must generalize.
- **Add negative data:** Include images without traffic signs, and common look-alikes (billboards, logos, buildings, vehicles), so the model stays robust against false positives.
